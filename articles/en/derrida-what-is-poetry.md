## The Independence, Multiplicity, Ambiguity, and Fluidity of Poetry

The attitude towards poetry should not be one of forcibly fitting it into a framework of "knowledge." Grasping poetry requires a more open attitude, one that maintains a critical distance from any knowledge system and cultural background, an attitude that deconstructs regularized, systematized conceptions of poetics.

The answer to the question "What is poetry?" is not a string of explicit words; poetry does not choose to expose its essence in this form. Poeticity is not a cold, fixed encoding of characters; the meaning of poetry is fluid, decentralized. Poetry is not just text; it is also the interaction between author and reader, the overlapping of language and sound, fleeting traces, the writing of memory and mood, and so on. Poetry is not subordinate to language; it is an independent mode of existence.

The meaning of poetry is multiple and ambiguous. It speaks to the unique individual, and also to vague, abstract beings. Poetry reveals itself in textual form, yet mysteriously conceals its core. Poetry is like a hedgehog: it defiantly points the spines on its surface towards the world, while also curling up to protect its torso. It has parts that are touchable yet sharp, and parts that are difficult to touch yet soft. Although it is itself fragile and sensitive, unable to escape the fate of being forgotten and misunderstood, it stubbornly leaves behind some destructive traces. The origin of poeticity lies in these very paradoxes.

The original form of a poem will be deconstructed in the process of translation; however, translation is necessary: it allows the poem to be liberated from its own place, and to enter the cultural and linguistic domain of an unknown other in a more adventurous, more chaotic state. After deconstruction, the body of the poem blooms, and thus it cannot be categorized under any single type of discourse.

## Derrida's Answer to the Question of Poeticity: "Heart"

Derrida answers this question with two terms:

1.  **Economy of Memory**
    Poetry will inevitably be a condensation of memory, meaning, and sensation.
2.  **Heart**
    Poetry needs to be "learned by heart" (apprendre par coeur). This process will be arduous, complex, and diverse. It is not a purely scientific object, nor can it be completely replaced by another linguistic form.

Poeticity is that which is "learned by heart" towards the other; in the life of a poem, every reading, every translation, every interpretation is an event, an arrival.

Poetry enables one to learn the "heart." The "heart" here is a power of the spirit/mind that transcends language, culture, and various structural constraints. This power is a self-unifying whole that erases all oppositions. Poetry is the secret code of the heart, conveying itself to the world with a unique rhythm and cadence.

## The Life of Poetry: Fragile, Dynamic, Transcendent

The meaning of a poem must be completed by the reader. The language of poetry points to the reader, leaving itself to the reader. The author is destroyed in this process—the author's own experience gradually disintegrates when read by the reader, overwritten by the reader's experience and their experience of the poem (disfigurement, transformation). Poetry thus constantly finds itself on a dynamic, fluid journey—from one port (port) to another. Poetry exposes itself to death; it is fragile, ephemeral, and risks danger, yet it resists death, attracting the reader's interpretation, memory, and dissemination. In this way, poetry is offered as a gift to the reader; it detaches itself from the author and becomes a part of the reader.

Poetry transcends its carrier language; it breaks free from within words, surpassing words and linguistic frameworks. It points to a broader world beyond language.
