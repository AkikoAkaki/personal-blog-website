## Deleuze's Schizophrenia and Artaud's Schizophrenia

- Deleuze views Artaud's schizophrenia as a miraculous language bursting with vitality within a breath-block of non-articulated words; this language is the "body without organs," possessing absolute depth.
- Artaud, however, regards schizophrenia as an object of resistance, a catastrophe that destroys subjectivity; he wrote delirium into his poetry to better thwart it.

## Madness

Madness is not a source of creative vitality, but the absence of the work, the absolute rupture of the work. Madness is an abyss, it is death, it is utter illusion. Poets and artists resist madness at its edge, thereby stimulating thought and creating works.

## Body Without Organs

This concept is contradictory; it allows lines of flight to pass through and is difficult to grasp. It can create vitality by dismantling the organism and unities, but it also implies non-productivity and barrenness. The meaning of this term is too fluid, ambiguous, and diffuse.

## The Fragmentation of the Body

- **The Anatomical Body**: Cutting the body into independent organs; it is the false body / the dead body. Anatomical incisions open up the body, leaving it to be controlled and alienated by the big Other.
- **The Body Without Organs**: The undamaged body. A desperate attempt to resist the big Other. It is a fantasy. Its existence should be denied.
- **The Archi-body / First Body (Archi-corps/corps premier)**: The primordial, infinite, undifferentiated body. The Absolute Body (Corps Absolu).
- **The Anti-Body (Anti-Corps)**: The god that invades and dissects the body. The despicable body.
