Models, composition, light, and depth of field—César Piette reconstructs the reality of painting in a modern and gentle way. His works are concise and lively: the titles briefly state the contents of the image, which are primarily simple compositions of portraits, animals, plants, and objects. From a distance, these paintings might appear to be computer-generated models. The objects have a smooth or glossy texture, like plastic or metal, and the background is distinctly blurred, creating a shallow depth of field effect reminiscent of a telephoto lens, which contrasts sharply with the subject. The majority of Piette's works are characterized by their bright colors, dynamic energy, and a charming, lively stillness.

To achieve this refined painting style, Piette first uses a computer to create models and then airbrushes the main subjects to minimize visible brushstrokes. Distinguishing itself from the trend of flatness in digital art, Piette's work embodies a kind of "artificial realism." Although viewers can instantly discern the difference between the objects in the paintings and their real-world counterparts, they become lost in the glossy sheens, textures, and detailed finishes that Piette meticulously crafts. Upon closer inspection, one can see hand-painted scratches, pits, and smudges. The artist draws the viewer into a multi-layered labyrinth of reality: each piece is an organic fusion of 3D computer modeling, painting, and photography. This process erases rigid boundaries and preserves vivid colors and vibrant dynamism, yet it eliminates the signs of life, leaving only its simulacrum.

Piette's work brings us back to Jean Baudrillard's questioning of reality. In his paintings, the simulacra of humans, animals, and plants exist not merely as imitations of the real. It could even be said that they no longer have any direct connection to their original archetypes but instead form a self-contained, fictional world. [^1] Judging from the titles, Piette seems to want to strip his work of any artificial traces. He names his pieces as if performing image recognition, listing their contents without any metaphor, artistic embellishment, or misuse of language, as if the works do not belong to the creator but are independent entities. Gazing at these creations, one feels they have been frozen in a moment by a camera, as though this instant were an insignificant part of their lives. These beings do not lack anthropological detail; they bear the marks of time and wear. They cannot be condemned, for they are harmless—devoid of strong narrative or emotion, possessing only a smooth surface.

So, what is "present" in such a painting—or rather, "rendering"? The painting simulates the rendering, and the rendering simulates the real. Yet, at the same time, the painting bypasses the rendering to directly depict the real. Meanwhile, "the real" is not solidified into a single image; it is confounding itself. From the era of Roland Barthes to that of Baudrillard, the realism and historical utility of photography disintegrated. From Baudrillard's time to the present, the digital image and the physical body compete, constituting an individual's form within society. The "reality" Piette depicts is perhaps manifested not only in the texture of the painting's content but also in the content itself. The digital image has become an inseparable part of reality.

Some of Piette's other works, however, adopt a starkly different style. Their texture is no longer candy-like, delicate, and cute, but instead shows signs of disorder and chaos. The subjects are still the same model-like figures or animals with a modeled texture, yet the canvas is no longer smooth. It is filled with splashes of ink, distortions, smudges, scratches, and even tears. Four such works are featured in this exhibition, and they share a common feature: round, gleaming, cartoonish eyeballs. The eyes stare directly at the viewer, posing a question: What makes these few models different from the others? Why is their world dirty and blurred, while the worlds of the others are clean and smooth? They are static on the canvas, yet the canvas itself is in turmoil. In these paintings, Piette questions his other works. In the worldview of the models, does this world exist in the seemingly harmless, smooth, and lovable style, or in a destructive force that is brutal, jagged, fragmented, and bursting? He guides the viewer to contemplate their own seemingly fixed backgrounds and structures from another perspective and mode of thought.

We can say that Piette moves cleverly between various media and styles. He is not satisfied with clichéd content and values, yet he presents his art in the most concise and accessible way. Even if stripped of all analysis and interpretation, his art remains so comforting, allowing one to feel the loveliness and beauty of things. His art is not just about itself; it is about humanity, about reality, and about technology.
